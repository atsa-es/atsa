# Q1. Change the observation model to all sites
# having the same observation error variance
# Is this more or less supported than all having different variance?

# Q2. Change to observation errors R="unconstrained"
# What does that mean? Are the erorrs correlated across sites? Why might that happen?

# Q3. Look at the observation variance and correlation matrix
# M=coef(fit, type="matrix")$R # Variance matrix
# cov2cor(M) # Correlation matrix
# What does this say about the observation errors?

# Q3. What does this model say about the observation variances? Same, different?

# Q4. Are we assuming that good years are correlated across sites or uncorrelated?

# Q3. Compare to a model with Q="diagonal and equal" and R="equalvarcov". Which one fits the data better based on AICc?

# Q4. How are these 2 models different? How are they different in terms of how they
# model correlation across the sites?
