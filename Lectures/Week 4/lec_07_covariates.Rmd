## Why include covariates in a model?

* We are often interested in knowing the cause of variation
* Covariates can explain the process that generated the patterns


```{r covariates, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa/Lectures/Week%204/msscov-plank-plot.png")
```

## Why include covariates in a model?

* You want to forecast something using covariates

```{r forecastsalmon, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa/Lectures/Week%207/images/forecastsalmon.png")
```

## Covariates -> Forecast

```{r out.width=c('300px', '350px'), out.extra='style="float:left; display:block; padding:30px"', echo=FALSE}

```

## Covariates in time series models

* Multivariate linear regression for time series data
* ARIMA models
    * Linear regression with ARMA errors
    * ARMAX
* MARSS models with covariates
    * Related to ARMAX

## Multivariate linear regression for time series data

Can you do a linear regression with time series data (response and predictors)? Yes, but you need to be careful.  Read Chapter 5 in [Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018]( https://otexts.com/fpp2/regression.html)

* Diagnostics that need to be satisfied
    * Residuals are temporally uncorrelated
    * Residuals are not correlated with the predictor variables
* Be careful regarding spurious correlation if both response and predictor variables have trends

## Linear regression with autocorrelated errors

The `xreg` argument in `Arima()` and `arima()` allows you to fit linear regressions with autocorrelated errors.  Read Chapter 9 in [Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018](https://otexts.com/fpp2/dynamic.html) on Dynamic Regression.

A linear regression with autocorrelated errors is for example:

$$y_t = \alpha + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{d}_t + \nu_t \\ \nu_t = \theta_1 \nu_{t-1} + \theta_2 \nu_{t-2} + e_t$$

## Fitting in R

### `Arima()`

```
fit <- Arima(y, xreg=d, order=c(1,1,0))
```

### `auto.arima()`

```
fit <- auto.arima(y, xreg=x)
```

## Example from Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4}
library(fpp2)
autoplot(uschange[,1:2], facets=TRUE) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Quarterly changes in US consumption
    and personal income")
```

## A simple regression has problems

```{r, fig.height=4}
y <- uschange[,"Consumption"]; d <- uschange[,"Income"]
fit <- lm(y~d)
checkresiduals(fit)
```

## Try AR(1) errors

```{r, fig.height=4}
fit <- Arima(y, xreg=d, order=c(1,0,0))
checkresiduals(fit)
```

## Let `auto.arima()` find best ARMA model

```{r}
fit <- auto.arima(y, xreg=d) # It finds a ARMA(1,0,2) is best.
checkresiduals(fit)
```


## Covariates in univariate state-space models

$$x_t = b x_{t-1}+ \mathbf{C} \mathbf{c}_t + w_t\\y_t = x_t + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{d}_t + v_t$$

Now we can model how covariates affect the hidden process.

## Covariates in univariate state-space models

$$x_t = x_{t-1}+ \boxed{\mathbf{C} \mathbf{c}_t} + w_t\\y_t = x_t + v_t$$
Random walk with drift. How does covariate affect the drift term, e.g. how does it affect population growth.

## Covariates in univariate state-space models

$$x_t = x_{t-1}+ u + w_t\\y_t = x_t + \boxed{\mathbf{D} \mathbf{d}_t + v_t}$$

How does covariate affect observation error relative to our stochastic trend.

## Covariates in MARSS models


$$\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{C} \mathbf{c}_t + \mathbf{w}_t \\ \mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{x}_{t} + \mathbf{D} \mathbf{d}_t + \mathbf{v}_t$$




## Covariates in state process

eg, nutrients affects growth, high temps kill...

$$\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B}_t\mathbf{x}_{t-1}+\mathbf{u}+\boxed{\mathbf{C}\mathbf{c}_t}+\mathbf{w}_t$$

$\boxed{\mathbf{C}\mathbf{c}_t}$ The covariate is in $\mathbf{c}_t$ and the effect is in matrix $\mathbf{C}$.  This is similar to how the covariate appears in a multivariate regression.

## Covariates in the state process

$$\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_t = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_{t-1} + \begin{bmatrix}C_a & C_b \\ C_a & C_b\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}temp \\ wind\end{bmatrix}_t + \begin{bmatrix}w_1 \\ w_2\end{bmatrix}_t$$
The model for $x_t$ in site 1 is:

$$x_{1,t}=x_{1,t-1}+C_a temp_t + C_b wind_t + w_{1,t}$$
There is an effect of the prior $x_t$ and an effect of temp and wind.

## The structure of $\mathbf{C}$

The structure of $\mathbf{C}$ can model different effect structures

**Effect of temp and wind is the same**

$$\begin{bmatrix}C & C \\ C & C\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}temp \\ wind\end{bmatrix}_t$$

###  .

**Effect of temp and wind is different but the same across sites, species, whatever the row in $\mathbf{x}$ is**

$$\begin{bmatrix}C_a & C_b \\ C_a & C_b\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}temp \\ wind\end{bmatrix}_t$$

##

**Effect of temp and wind is different across sites or whatever the row in $\mathbf{x}$ is**

$$\begin{bmatrix}C_{a1} & C_{b1} \\ C_{a2} & C_{b2}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}temp \\ wind\end{bmatrix}_t$$

###  .

**Effect of temp is the same across sites but wind is not**

$$\begin{bmatrix}C_{a} & C_{b1} \\ C_{a} & C_{b2}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}temp \\ wind\end{bmatrix}_t$$

## Covariate in the observation process

eg, vegetation obscures individuals, temperature affects behavior making animals more or less visible

$$\mathbf{y}_t = \boxed{\mathbf{Z}\mathbf{x}_{t}+\mathbf{a}}+\boxed{\mathbf{D}\mathbf{d}_t+\mathbf{w}_t}$$

## Covariates in the observation process

$$\begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\ y_2 \\y_3\end{bmatrix}_t = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}_{t} + \begin{bmatrix}D_a & D_b \\ D_a & D_b \\D_a & D_b\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}temp \\ wind\end{bmatrix}_t + \begin{bmatrix}v_1 \\ v_2 \\v_3\end{bmatrix}_t$$
In this case the covariate does not affect the _state_ $x$.  It only affects the observation of the state.

The model for $y_t$ in site 1 is:

$$y_{1,t}=x_{1,t}+D_a temp_t + D_b wind_t + v_{1,t}$$

## The structure of $\mathbf{D}$

The structure of $\mathbf{D}$ can model many different structures of the effects.

**Effect of temp and wind is the same across sites 1 & 2 but different for site 3.  In site 3, temp has an effect but wind does not**

$$\begin{bmatrix}D_a & D_b \\ D_a & D_b \\ D_c & 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}temp \\ wind\end{bmatrix}_t$$




## Why include covariates in a model?

* We want to understand how covariates drive the hidden process.

* We want to test hypotheses for what caused a perturbation or change in the dynamics.

* We want to forecast using covariates.

* We want to model the _autocorrelation in the process errors_ using the known driver.

## Why include covariates in a model?

**Auto-correlated observation errors**

* Model your $v_t$ as a AR-1 process. hard numerically with a large multivariate state-space model

* If know what is causing the auto-correlation, include that as a covariate. Easier.

**Correlated observation errors across sites or species (y rows)**

* Use a $\mathbf{R}$ matrix with off-diagonal terms. really hard numerically

* If you know or suspect what is causing the correlation, include that as a covariate. Easier.

"hard numerically" = you need a lot of data

## Seasonality

* Different approaches to modeling seasonality
   * Factors
   * Sines and cosines (Fourier series)
   * Polynomials
   

* Dealing with missing covariates
   * Modeling the covariates as a hidden process
* Dealing with collinearity in your covariates
* Lab to practice analyzing population data and infer effects of covariates on year-to-year growth rates
