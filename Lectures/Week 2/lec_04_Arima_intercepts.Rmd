## Cover on your own: Intercepts and drift in `Arima()`

$d=0$ `Arima(x, order=c(1,0,0), include.drift=FALSE, include.mean=TRUE)`

$m$ is estimated and called `intercept`.

$$(x_t-m) = \phi_1 (x_{t-1}-m) + w_t$$
`Arima(x, order=c(1,0,0), include.drift=TRUE, include.mean=FALSE)`

$\mu$ is estimated and called `drift`.

$$x_t = \mu + \phi_1 x_{t-1} + w_t$$

##

`Arima(x, order=c(1,0,0), include.drift=TRUE, include.mean=TRUE)`

$\mu$ and $m$ are estimated and called `drift` and `intercept`.

$$(x_t-m) = \mu + \phi_1 (x_{t-1}-m) + w_t$$

##

If $d=1$, then `include.mean` is ignored in `Arima()` and `include.drift` estimates an intercept like `include.mean` in the $d=0$ case, but it is called `drift` in the output. $y_t = x_t-x_{t-1}$.

* `Arima(x, order=c(1,1,0), include.drift=TRUE)`

$m$ is estimated and called `drift`. 

$$(y_t-m) = \phi_1 (y_{t-1}-m) + w_t$$

* `Arima(x, order=c(1,1,0), include.drift=FALSE)`

$$y_t = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + w_t$$

##

* `Arima(x, order=c(0,1,0), include.drift=TRUE)`

This is a random walk with drift.

$$(y_t-m) = w_t$$
which is

$$x_t = m + x_{t-1} + w_t$$

##

If $d\ge2$, then both `include.mean` and `include.drift` are ignored. $z_t = y_t-y_{t-1} = (x_t - x_{t-1}) - (x_{t-1}-x_{t-2})$.

* `Arima(x, order=c(1,2,0))`

$$z_t = \phi_1 z_{t-1} + w_t$$

## Intercepts in `arima()`

If $d=0$, 

* `arima(x, order=c(1,0,0), include.mean=TRUE)`

$m$ is estimated and called `intercept`.

$$(x_t-m) = \phi_1 (x_{t-1}-m) + w_t$$

##

If $d=1$, then `include.mean` is ignored and no intercept can be estimated. 

* `arima(x, order=c(1,1,0), include.mean=TRUE)`

$$y_t = \phi_1 y_{t-1}+ w_t$$

* `arima(x, order=c(0,1,0))`

Because an intercept cannot be estimated, this means that a random walk with drift cannot be estimated by `arima()`.

$$y_t = w_t$$
only can be estimated which is random walk without drift.

$$x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t$$
