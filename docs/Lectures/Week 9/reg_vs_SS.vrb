\frametitle{Fitted}
\protect\hypertarget{fitted}{}
You need to be careful to think about what you mean by \texttt{fitted()}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{gls(y\textasciitilde{}x)} and similar would return
  \(E[\alpha+\beta x_t]\)
\item
  \texttt{arima(y,\ xreg=x)} returns
  \(E[\alpha+\beta x_t + e_t|y_{1:t-1}]\)
\item
  state-space model would get you \(E[\alpha+\beta x_t + f_t|y_{1:N}]\)
\end{itemize}
