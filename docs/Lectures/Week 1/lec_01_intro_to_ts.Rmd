## Classification of time series | By some _index set_

Interval across real time; $x(t)$    

* begin/end: $t \in [1.1,2.5]$    


## Classification of time series | By some _index set_

Discrete time; $x_t$    

* Equally spaced: $t = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$  
* Equally spaced w/ missing value: $t = \{1,2,4,5,6\}$  
* Unequally spaced: $t = \{2,3,4,6,9\}$  


## Classification of time series | By the _underlying process_    

Discrete (eg, total # of fish caught per trawl)

Continuous (eg, salinity, temperature)


## Classification of time series | By the _number of values recorded_    

Univariate/scalar (eg, total # of fish caught)    

Multivariate/vector (eg, # of each spp of fish caught)


## Classification of time series | By the _type of values recorded_    

Integer (eg, # of fish in 5 min trawl = 2413)

Rational (eg, fraction of unclipped fish = 47/951)

Real (eg, fish mass = 10.2 g)

Complex (eg, cos(2π2.43) + _i_ sin(2π2.43))


## Classification of time series | We will focus on integers & real-values in discrete time

Univariate $(x_t)$

<br>

Multivariate $\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix}_t$


## Time series objects in R

Time series objects have a special designation in R: `ts`

```{r ts_example, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ts(data,
   start, end,
   frequency
   )
```


## Time series objects in R

Time series objects have a special designation in R: `ts`

```{r ts_example_2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
### <b>
ts(data,
   ### </b>
   start, end,
   frequency
   )
```

`data` should be a vector (univariate)

or a data frame or matrix (multivariate)


## Time series objects in R

Time series objects have a special designation in R: `ts`

```{r ts_example_3, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ts(data,
   ### <b>
   start, end,
   ### </b>
   frequency
   )
```

`start` and `end` give the first and last time indices

For monthly series, specify them as `c(year, month)`


## Time series objects in R

Time series objects have a special designation in R: `ts`

```{r ts_example_4, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ts(data,
   start, end,
   ### <b>
   frequency
   ### </b>
   )
```

`frequency` is the number of observations per unit time

For annual series, `frequency = 1`

For monthly series, `frequency = 12`


## Time series objects in R

Time series objects have a special designation in R: `ts`

```{r ts_example_5, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ts(data,
   start, end,
   ### <b>
   deltat
   ### </b>
   )
```

`deltat` is the fraction of the sampling period

For annual series, `deltat = 1`

For monthly series, `deltat = 1/12`


## Time series objects in R

```{r ts_example_6, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(507)

## annual data
dat_1 <- rnorm(30)
dat_yr <- ts(dat_1,
             start = 1991, end = 2020,
             frequency = 1)

## monthly data
dat_2 <- rnorm(30*12)
dat_mo <- ts(dat_2,
             start = c(1991, 1), end = c(2020, 12),
             frequency = 12)
```


## Plotting time series objects in R

There is a designated function for plotting `ts` objects: `plot.ts()`

```{r plotts_example, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot.ts(ts_object)
```


## Plotting time series objects in R

```{r plotts_example_2}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(dat_yr)
```


## Plotting time series objects in R

We can specify some additional arguments to `plot.ts`

```{r plotts_example_3, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot.ts(dat_yr,
        ylab = expression(italic(x[t])),
        las = 1, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```


## Plotting time series objects in R

```{r plotts_example_4}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(dat_yr,
        ylab = expression(italic(x[t])), las = 1, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

# Analysis of time series


## Statistical analyses of time series

Most statistical analyses are concerned with estimating properties of a population from a sample

For example, we use fish caught in a seine to infer the mean size of fish in a lake


## Statistical analyses of time series

Time series analysis, however, presents a different situation:

* Although we could vary the _length_ of an observed time series, it is often impossible to make multiple observations at a _given_ point in time


## Statistical analyses of time series

Time series analysis, however, presents a different situation:

* Although we could vary the _length_ of an observed time series, it is often impossible to make multiple observations at a _given_ point in time

For example, one can’t observe today’s closing price of Microsoft stock more than once  

Thus, conventional statistical procedures, based on large sample estimates, are inappropriate


## Descriptions of time series

```{r ex_ts_plot_www, fig.cap = "Number of users connected to the internet"}
data(WWWusage)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(WWWusage, ylab = "", las = 1, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```


## Descriptions of time series

```{r ex_ts_plot_lynx, fig.cap = "Number of lynx trapped in Canada from 1821-1934"}
data(lynx)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(lynx, ylab = "", las = 1, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```


## What is a time series model?

A _time series model_ for $\{x_t\}$ is a specification of the _joint distributions_ of a sequence of _random variables_ $\{X_t\}$, of which $\{x_t\}$ is thought to be a realization


## Joint distributions of random variables

```{r ex_ts_plot_joint_dist}
set.seed(123)
nn <- 50
tt <- 40
ww <- matrix(rnorm(nn*tt), tt, nn)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
matplot(ww, type="l", lty="solid",  las = 1,
        ylab = expression(italic(X[t])), xlab = "Time",
        col = gray(0.5, 0.4))
```


## We have one realization

```{r ex_ts_plot_joint_dist_2}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
matplot(ww, type="l", lty="solid",  las = 1,
        ylab = expression(italic(X[t])), xlab = "Time",
        col = gray(0.5, 0.4))
lines(ww[,1], col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```


## Some simple time series models

```{r ex_WN}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
matplot(ww, type="l", lty="solid",  las = 1,
        ylab = expression(italic(x[t])), xlab = "Time",
        col = gray(0.5, 0.4))
```

White noise: $x_t \sim N(0,1)$


## Some simple time series models

```{r ex_RW}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
matplot(apply(ww, 2, cumsum), type="l", lty="solid",  las = 1,
        ylab = expression(italic(x[t])), xlab = "Time",
        col = gray(0.5, 0.4))
```

Random walk: $x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t,~\text{with}~w_t \sim N(0,1)$


## Classical decomposition

### Model time series $\{x_t\}$ as a combination of

1. trend ($m_t$)  
2. seasonal component ($s_t$)  
3. remainder ($e_t$)

$x_t = m_t + s_t + e_t$


## Classical decomposition | 1. The trend ($m_t$)

We need a way to extract the so-called _signal_ from the _noise_

One common method is via "linear filters"

Linear filters can be thought of as "smoothing" the data


## Classical decomposition | 1. The trend ($m_t$)

Linear filters typically take the form

$$
\hat{m}_t = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} \lambda_i x_{t+1}
$$


## Classical decomposition | 1. The trend ($m_t$)

For example, a moving average

$$
\hat{m}_t = \sum_{i=-a}^{a} \frac{1}{2a + 1} x_{t+i}
$$


## Classical decomposition | 1. The trend ($m_t$)

For example, a moving average

$$
\hat{m}_t = \sum_{i=-a}^{a} \frac{1}{2a + 1} x_{t+i}
$$

If $a = 1$, then

$$
\hat{m}_t = \frac{1}{3}(x_{t-1} + x_t + x_{t+1})
$$


## Classical decomposition | 1. The trend ($m_t$)

For example, a moving average

$$
\hat{m}_t = \sum_{i=-a}^{a} \frac{1}{2a + 1} x_{t+i}
$$

As $a$ increases, the estimated trend becomes more smooth


## Example of linear filtering

```{r plot_airpass, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
xx <- AirPassengers
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(xx, las = 1, ylab = "")
```


## Example of linear filtering

```{r plot_airpass_fltr1, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(xx, las = 1, ylab = "")
## weights for moving avg
fltr <- c(1,1,1)/3
trend <- filter(xx, filter=fltr, method="convo", sides=2)
lines(trend, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE),
     labels = expression(paste("a = 1; ", lambda, " = 1/3")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "blue")
```


## Example of linear filtering

```{r plot_airpass_fltr2, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(xx, las = 1, ylab = "")
## weights for moving avg
fltr2 <- rep(1,9)/9
trend2 <- filter(xx, filter=fltr2, method="convo", sides=2)
lines(trend, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
lines(trend2, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE),
     labels = expression(paste("a = 1; ", lambda, " = 1/3")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "blue")
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE)*0.9,
     labels = expression(paste("a = 4; ", lambda, " = 1/9")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "darkorange")
```


## Example of linear filtering

```{r plot_airpass_fltr3, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(xx, las = 1, ylab = "")
## weights for moving avg
fltr3 <- rep(1,27)/27
trend3 <- filter(xx, filter=fltr3, method="convo", sides=2)
lines(trend, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
lines(trend2, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)
lines(trend3, col = "darkred", lwd = 2)
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE),
     labels = expression(paste("a = 1; ", lambda, " = 1/3")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "blue")
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE)*0.9,
     labels = expression(paste("a = 4; ", lambda, " = 1/9")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "darkorange")
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE)*0.8,
     labels = expression(paste("a = 13; ", lambda, " = 1/27")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "darkred")
```


## Classical decomposition | 2. Seasonal effect ($s_t$)

Once we have an estimate of the trend $\hat{m}_t$, we can estimate $\hat{s}_t$ simply by subtraction:

$$
\hat{s}_t = x_t - \hat{m}_t
$$


## Classical decomposition

```{r plot_airpass_decomp_seas, fig.cap = ""}
seas <- trend2 - xx
  
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(seas, las = 1, ylab = "")
# text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE)*0.9,
#      labels = expression(paste(lambda, " = 1/9")),
#      adj = c(0,0), col = "darkorange")
```

Seasonal effect ($\hat{s}_t$), assuming $\lambda = 1/9$


## Classical decomposition | 2. Seasonal effect ($s_t$)

But, $\hat{s}_t$ really includes the remainder $e_t$ as well

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{s}_t &= x_t - \hat{m}_t \\
(s_t + e_t) &= x_t - m_t
\end{align}
$$

## Classical decomposition | 2. Seasonal effect ($s_t$)

So we need to estimate the _mean_ seasonal effect as 

$$
\hat{s}_{Jan} = \sum \frac{1}{(N/12)} \{s_1, s_{13}, s_{25}, \dots \} \\
\hat{s}_{Feb} = \sum \frac{1}{(N/12)} \{s_2, s_{14}, s_{26}, \dots \} \\
\vdots \\
\hat{s}_{Dec} = \sum \frac{1}{(N/12)} \{s_{12}, s_{24}, s_{36}, \dots \} \\
$$


## Mean seasonal effect ($s_t$)

```{r mean_seasonal_effects}
seas_2 <- decompose(xx)$seasonal
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(seas_2, las = 1, ylab = "")
```


## Classical decomposition | 3. Remainder ($e_t$)

Now we can estimate $e_t$ via subtraction:

$$
\hat{e}_t = x_t - \hat{m}_t - \hat{s}_t
$$


## Remainder ($e_t$)

```{r errors}
ee <- decompose(xx)$random
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(ee, las = 1, ylab = "")
```


## Let's try a different model | With some other assumptions

1. Log-transform data

2. Linear trend


## Log-transformed data

```{r plot_ln_airpass, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
lx <- log(AirPassengers)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(lx, las = 1, ylab = "")
```


## The trend ($m_t$)

```{r plot_lin_trend}
tt <- as.vector(time(xx))
cc <- coef(lm(lx ~ tt))
pp <- cc[1] + cc[2] * tt
  
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(tt, lx, type="l", las = 1,
     xlab = "Time", ylab = "")
lines(tt, pp, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```


## Seasonal effect ($s_t$) with error ($e_t$)

```{r seas_ln_dat}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(lx-pp)
```


## Mean seasonal effect ($s_t$)

```{r mean_seas_effects}
## length of ts
ll <- length(lx)
## frequency (ie, 12)
ff <- frequency(lx)
## number of periods (years); %/% is integer division
periods <- ll %/% ff
## index of cumulative month
index <- seq(1,ll,by=ff) - 1
## get mean by month
mm <- numeric(ff)
for(i in 1:ff) {
  mm[i] <- mean(lx[index+i], na.rm=TRUE)
}
## subtract mean to make overall mean=0
mm <- mm - mean(mm)
seas_2 <- ts(rep(mm, periods+1)[seq(ll)],
               start=start(lx), 
               frequency=ff)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(seas_2, las = 1, ylab = "")
```


## Remainder ($e_t$)

```{r ln_errors}
le <- lx - pp - seas_2
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(le, las = 1, ylab = "")
```
