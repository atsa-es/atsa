# Question one
# Change the x (state) model to x_t = x_{t-1} + u
# Don't change the y (observation) model
# What happens to the fit and forecast? Why?

# Question two
# Change the x (state) model to x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t
# Don't change the y (observation) model
# What happens to the fit and forecast? Why?

# Question three
# Change the x (state) model to x_t = u
# Don't change the y (observation) model
# Also SET x0 to 0 for this question; x0 = matrix(0). Otherwise the problem is underconstrained.
# What happens to the fit and forecast? Why?
