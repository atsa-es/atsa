# Grading

Your grade for the course will come from four elements.

### Homework (30%)

Homework will be assigned each Thursday and is due by 11:59 PM PST on the following Tuesday. It will consist of some short answers and __R__ code based on topics covered in lab. There will be 6 assignments worth 5% each.  Your learning in the class will be greatly enhanced by doing the homework which consist of applying the material you learn in each lecture to a data set.

### Individual project (40%)  

Each student will have to write a complete, publishable (<20 page) paper that may, or may not, serve as a component of their thesis/dissertation. Given that some students might not have their own data. Students may also use data from the instructors, or datasets included in __R__ libraries. See [list of prior student projects](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa/student_pubs.html) for the types of projects done is prior years.

The techniques you will be learning would be appropriate for the [EFI RCN NEON Ecological Forecast Challenge](The https://ecoforecast.org/efi-rcn-forecast-challenges/) happening concurrently with the 2021 Fish 507 course. You are welcome to do one of the challenges as your individual project. You do not need to formally participate in the challenge (i.e. register as a team but you are welcome to do so). All the data are provided and the challenge lays out the goals (what to forecast) for each challenge. The Aquatic Ecosystems, Tick Abundance, and Beetle Abundance challenges would be appropriate for the class.

### Peer reviews (20%)  

Each student will have to provide 2 anonymous peer-reviews of their colleaguesâ€™ papers (10% each).

### Participation (10%)  

This is a graduate-level course and we expect a certain amount of engagement from each student, which includes attending and participating lectures and computer labs.
