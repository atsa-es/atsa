# Grading

Your grade for the course will come from 4 elements.

### Homework (30%)  
Homework will be assigned each Thursday and is due by 5:00 PM PST on the following Thursday. It will consist of some short answers and __R__ code based on topics covered in lab. There will be 6 assignments worth 5% each.

Homework will be submitted via...

### Individual project (40%)  
Each student will have to write a complete, publishable (<20 page) paper that may, or may not, serve as a component of their thesis/dissertation. Given that some students might not have their own data, these papers can be done alone, or in pairs (expectations will be higher for joint work). Students may also use data from the instructors, or datasets included in __R__ libraries. 
### Peer reviews (20%)  
Each student will have to provide 2 anonymous peer-reviews of their colleaguesâ€™ papers (10% each).

### Participation (10%)  
This is a graduate-level course and we expect a certain amount of engagement from each student, which includes attending lectures and computer labs.
